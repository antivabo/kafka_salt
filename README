Tasks:
1) Install kafka (and its dependencies) on the host using your preferred configuration management system. Leave a README file in the home directory describing what tool you used and where we can see the configuration (if you install from a remote machine, please upload all relevant files to the home directory)

2) Write a script to test the broker: it should use kafka CLI to simply send a message with some text and then receive it, if the message
is received properly, the tool should return 0 and print "SUCCESS". Indicate the location of the script in the README file.

Solution:
0. Hostname should be resolvable. Edit '/etc/hosts' if necessary.
1. Unpack saltformulas and pillars from salt-masterless.tgz to '/srv'
2. Copy file 'minion' to '/etc/salt/minion' or add to it lines below:
        file_roots:
            base:
                - /srv/salt-masterless/salt/roots
                - /srv/salt-masterless/formulas
        pillar_roots:
            base:
                - /srv/salt-masterless/salt/pillars
3. Dont forget to restart salt-minion service
4. sudo salt-call --local state.highstate
   This will apply all fromulas and install java, zookeeper and kafka
5. Run test script ./test.sh.
   Check that it is completed with 'SUCCESS' string.
